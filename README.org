#+TITLE: My Emacs Config

I will try to kee this up to date
* IMPORTANT
 NOTE: The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll
 need to run the following command interactively so that mode line icons
 display correctly:
 M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
* Packages
** vterm
need to install cmake
using homebrew 
#+begin_src
brew install cmake
#+end_src

on Arch
#+begin_src
sudo pacman -S cmake
#+end_src

on Void Linux
#+begin_src 
sudo xbps-install -S cmake libtool
#+end_src

* Key bindings
The default leader key is <SPC>. The global is <C-SPC>, use this whenever
evil mode is not used, currently magit, dired, and ibuffer all need to use the global
prefix.
