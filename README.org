#+TITLE: My Emacs Config

* IMPORTANT
 NOTE: The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll
 need to run the following command interactively so that mode line icons
 display correctly:
 =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=
* Packages
** vterm
need to install =cmake=
*** Homebrew 
#+begin_src
brew install cmake
#+end_src

*** Nixos
add this to your =home.nix= to install emacs with vterm built in.
#+begin_src nix
programs.emacs = {
	enable = true;
	extraPackages = epkgs: [
	epkgs.vterm
	];
};
#+end_src
*** Arch
#+begin_src
sudo pacman -S cmake
#+end_src

*** Void Linux
#+begin_src 
sudo xbps-install -S cmake libtool
#+end_src

** Ditaa
used to make graphics out of ASCII in org src-blocks. Find where ever =ditaa.jar= is and
link it to a folder in =.emacs.d=. the default folder in =init-org.el= is =links=


* Key bindings
The default leader key is <SPC>. The global is <C-SPC>, use this whenever
evil mode is not used. Currently magit and dired need to use the global
prefix.
